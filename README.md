# Witify Starter Template
Witify HTML5 and Javascript Starter Template 

This template contains many libraries in the bower.json file:
* Bootstrap Sass 
* PACE - Page loading Animation
* Chart.js - Charting Library
* Slick Slider - Slider Library
* Vue.js
* JQuery

One must verify the main.scss if some libraries are removed.

## Todo in near future
* Implement Browerify for minified js files and refactoring
* Install all via Yarn instead of bower
* Vue Router for Routes
* Vue i18n for translations
* Simplify the navbar
* Contact Form with validations
* VueJs 2.0?
